# Collatz-Sequences
A python algorithm for finding the longest Collatz Sequence of every number up to a given number.
A Collatz Sequence is derived from the following rules:
If x is 1: stop
If x is even: divide by 2 and continue
If x is odd: multiply by 3 then add 1 and continue
You will need to change the labeled n in the algorithm. It represents the largest number you would like to check for Collatz Sequence length.
For example, if you change n to 5, the program will determine the number with the longest Collatz Sequence from 1 to 5 and return it.
In this case, the algorith will return 3.
